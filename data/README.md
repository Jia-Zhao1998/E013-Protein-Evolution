This csv is a processed table in a singlets format to summarize all of the plate reading results from 2021-04-22 by Jia Zhao\
This experiment is to test if adding extra Pi and/or adenine could rescue the fitness defect of *pho2* seen in previous spotting assay by comparing chimera Sc(1-224)Cg(381-533) in *pho2* background-A17 and *PHO2* background-B17.

  - Score is the the average plate reader reading of three tecnical replicates (take three readings for the same plate).
  - Pi level: No Pi, 1X Pi (standard SC media, 7.35 mM), 2X, 3X (Produced by adding KH2PO4 solution)
  - Ade level: 1X (standard SC media, 0.135 mM), 2X, 3X, 4X (Produced by adding Ade solution)
